For this, let us recall the basic economic interpretation of the [relations](#relations), which we had previously spelled out: Expression for [$v$](#relations) captures the problem of a firm of type $y$, which hires a worker $x$ who offers the best trade-off between production if hired by $y$ (that is $\\Phi\\left(  x,y\\right)=x^{\\intercal}y$) and wage $u\\left(  x\\right)$. Thus, firm $y$ will be willing to match with any worker whithin the set of maximizers of [$v$](#relations)), while worker $x$ will be willing to match with any firm whithin the set of maximizers of [$u$](#relations) .
